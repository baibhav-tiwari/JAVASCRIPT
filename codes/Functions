//  function : a javascript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task and is executed when " something " calls it !!
//  arguments : function arguments are the values received by the function when it is called,they behave as variables ,however they only live within the function and cannot be accessed outside of it.
// template-litreals : template literals provide an easy way to interpolate variables and expression into strings, interpolation is an effecient way of concatenation

// 1-normal function
function name() {
    console.log('baibhav')
}
name()

//2- function with arguments
function boy(Name) {
    console.log(Name)
}
boy("baibhav")

//3- with string concatenation
function greeting(everyone) {
    greet = "hey " + everyone + ",a very good afternoon to all of you"
    console.log(greet)
}
greeting("classmates")

//4 - template literals
function greetings(you) {
    greets = `hi ${you}, Nice to meet you!`
    console.log(greets)
}
greetings('iron man')
